=====

## Introduction
The purpose of this framework is to create a stack to enable MVVM development tightly integrated with the latest WinJS 4+ apis.

The MVVM pattern is a close variant of the Presentation Model pattern, optimized to leverage some of the core capabilities of WinJS, such as data binding, data templates and commands.

In the MVVM pattern, the view encapsulates the UI and any UI logic, the view model encapsulates presentation logic and state, and the model encapsulates business logic and data. The view interacts with the view model through data binding, commands, and change notification events. The view model queries, observes, and coordinates updates to the model, converting, validating, and aggregating data as necessary for display in the view.
